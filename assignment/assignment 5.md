# Q5: Ramp Climbing Karel

Write a program that has Karel draw a diagonal line across the world, with a slope of ½, like so:

The key to drawing a diagonal line with slope ½ is to move two steps forward and one step up between each beeper. In this problem you can and should assume that the world is an **odd number** of columns across. Solving the problem for even columns as well is much harder and would count as an "extension".

You should assume

    Karel **always begins** at the bottom left corner of and empty world facing East.

    You may assume that the world is an **odd number** of columns across

    Karel's bag has infinite beepers.

    It does not matter which direction Karel ends up facing.

    The world is always square (the world's height is the same as its width)
