# Q4: Cleanup Karel, Milestone 2

Karel has a bit of spring cleaning to do! Karel's world will have beepers in some positions in the bottom row; write a program to have Karel walk across the bottom row and, at each position, pick up a beeper only if one is present. Notice that you've already written the code to check if a beeper is present and only pick up a beeper if one is there from the previous milestone -- you should use your code from the previous milestone as a helper function to help with the decomposition of this problem!

Additionally, note that Karel's starting position will never contain a beeper, so there's no need to check it.

For example, if this is the initial starting world, with some beepers in the first row:

This should be the end result, with a clear bottom row:

We've provided you two worlds on which to test your code. You can toggle between them by changing the very last line in the file from **run_karel_program('Cleanup1.w')** to **run_karel_program('Cleanup2.w')** (and vice versa) -- you will likely need to press Run (it's fine if you do so without any code written) for the world change to take effect.
