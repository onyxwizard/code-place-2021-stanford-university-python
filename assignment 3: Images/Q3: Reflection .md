# Q3 (optional; medium): Reflection

Write a function that returns an output image that is twice the height of the original. The top half of the output image should be identical to the original image. The bottom half, however, should look like a reflection of the top half. The highest row in the top half should be “reflected” to be the lowest row in the bottom half. This results in a cool effect.
Two images. Left image depicts a snowy mountain with a forest in the foreground. Right image is twice as tall; the top half is the same as the left image and the bottom half is the left image reflected across a horizontal axis so that the photo looks like the mountain range is reflected across a lake.
