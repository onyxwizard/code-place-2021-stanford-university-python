# Q4 (optional; hard): Warhol Effect

Write an algorithm that takes in a square patch like this photo of Simba the Dog: 
Small fluffy dog with light brown fur, smiling cutely :)
<p align="center">
<img align="center" src="/images/a3-q41.png">
</p>

 And creates an image which has the patch copied 6 times (in 2 rows and 3 columns) where each patch gets re-colored. This effect is inspired by some of Andy Warhol’s paintings. 
Six images of cute fluffy dog from previous image, tiled together in 2 rows of 3, each image filtered a different way.

We strongly recommend implementing a function, like so:
```
def make_recolored_patch(red_scale, green_scale, blue_scale): 
```
Which returns a new colored patch. See the starter code for details.

Don’t try to match the colors in this example exactly. Experiment with different combinations of red_scale, green_scale and blue_scale. The pink Simba was generated by 
```
make_recolored_patch(1.5, 0, 1.5)
```
A few milestones:
Pink-filtered tile of cute fluffy dog in top left corner of canvas. The rest of the image / canvas is blank (white).
Three images of cute fluffy dog, tiled in a row across the top half of the canvas. The bottom half of the canvas is blank (white).

Define other functions too! How about a function which adds a colored patch to the final_image at a given row, column?
