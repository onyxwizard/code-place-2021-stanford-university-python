# Extension (optional!)

If you finish early, you may optionally write a Karel project of your own choice. Modify this file to use Karel to complete any task of your choosing! Extensions are a great chance for practice and to be creative. Make sure to write comments to explain what your program is doing and update the world to be appropriate for your program. (Notice that you can toggle the rows and columns of Karel's world, and if you right click Karel's world, you'll see a dropdown of other things you can do by clicking!)
